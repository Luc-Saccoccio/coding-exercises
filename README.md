# Coding Contests

Here is a collection of program I coded for programming contests/games on Internet.

## 99 Problems

A collection of 99 problems originally for Prolog, then Lisp, then OCaml and Haskell ?

Problems targeting functional/partially functional languages, great to get the basics right.

## Advent Of Code

The years from 2015 to 2019 were done outside context

The years after were done in conditions _for some problems_

## CodeForces

Started in 2021. Very useful to train my skills on any language.

## Exercism

Great website for language-specific test with general (mostly) problems.

Used for
- C
- Common Lisp (someday)
- Go
- Haskell
- OCaml
- Prolog (someday ?)
- Python
- Rust

## Hackerrank

Collection of (random) problems. Organized by languages and category.

## Project Euler

Coding is great, math is life: Project Euler is an excellent website for math-related problems.

## Prologin

- Tried in 2020/2021, failed.
- Tried again in 2021/2022, failed again.
- Maye 2022/2023 ?
